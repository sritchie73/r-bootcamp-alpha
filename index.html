<h2>General Information</h2>

<p>
  <a href="//software-carpentry.org">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
  is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
  by teaching them basic lab skills for computing
  like program design, version control, data management, and task automation.
  This two-day hands-on bootcamp will cover basic concepts and tools;
  participants will be encouraged to help one another
  and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems.

<p>
  <strong>Who:</strong>
  This bootcamp is a trial run of the R software carpentry materials, which will 
  bring together experienced R users, potential helpers and instructors, and 
  novice R users.

  <strong>Requirements:</strong>
  Participants are asked to bring their laptop. They will be given access
  to the <a href="https://its.unimelb.edu.au/research/our_services/cloud_computing/research_cloud">NeCTAR Research Cloud</a>
  for the duration of the bootcamp (and beyond), so it's critical that this
  laptop is able to connect to either the UniWireless or Eduroam wifi networks.
  Since the NeCTAR Research Cloud has all the required software installed, 
  participants are not required to install any software on their own laptop prior to the bootcamp.

<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>
  The bootcamp will run from 9-4:30, and will be split into four sessions:
  there will be two 15 minute coffe breaks at 10:30 and 14:30, and a one hour
  lunch break at 1pm.
</p>
<p>
  Tea and coffee will be provided, and microwaves are available.
</p>

<!--
    Edit this block to show what topics will be covered.
-->
<h2>Syllabus</h2>
<p>
The syllabus will teach the fundamentals of scientific programming, 
covering the foundations of software development and design, via an 
introduction to the R statistical programming language.
</p>
<p>
The high level concepts this bootcamp subset will impart are <emph>defensive programming</emph>,
<emph>error handling</emph>, <emph>debugging</emph>, <emph>unit testing</emph> and
<emph>test-driven development</emph>. These skills are transferrable to any language.
</p>
<p>
The bootcamp also seeks to cover the fundamentals of the R language, providing a
solid foundation to learn from. R materials will be selected from the 
<a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc/blob/master/intermediate/r">
  Software Carpentry intermediate R material
</a>
Ideally bootcamp attendees will have used R before, and want to learn more, 
however complete novices are also welcome.

    Edit the setup instructions in _includes/setup.html to reflect your bootcamp.
    (In particular, most bootcamps teach either Python or R, not both.)
-->

<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>
Prior to the bootcamp, University of Melbourne staff/students should ensure
that their laptop can connect to UniWireless. Instructions on how to do this
and where to get assistance can be found
<a href="https://its.unimelb.edu.au/help/networks-access/networks-internet/connect-wireless/unimelb">here</a>. 
Attendees from other Australian universities should find out (from the IT 
website of their home institution) how to connect to the Eduroam wireless 
network.
</p>
<p>
Since the bootcamp will be conducted on the NeCTAR Research Cloud, participants 
are not required to install any software prior to the bootcamp. For those people
who'd like to install the software used in the bootcamp on their own machine for
use after the bootcamp, we've included the relevant installation instructions
below (and we're happy to provide assistance with this during the bootcamp).
